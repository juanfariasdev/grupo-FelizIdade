## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light blue (#ADD8E6), evoking a sense of calm, health, and serenity. It's welcoming without being overly stimulating.
- Background color: Very pale blue (#F0F8FF), nearly white, providing a clean, fresh, and uncluttered feel. It supports readability and a sense of spaciousness.
- Accent color: Soft green (#90EE90), analogous to blue, but brighter and more saturated. To highlight important calls to action.
- Font pairing: 'Alegreya' for headers and titles (serif), 'PT Sans' for body text (sans-serif). This pairing offers a balance of classic elegance and modern readability.
- Use clear, universally understandable icons. The style should be simple, line-based icons with rounded corners, and of the same hue as the primary color
- Clean and spacious layout with generous margins and padding, creating a comfortable reading experience.
- Subtle animations, like smooth scrolling and fade-in effects, to add a touch of elegance without being distracting.
